# The Thought Exchange
The Thought Exchange was created to build an engaging space for civil discussions and disagreements. Initially this project will be a front-end only project with the goal of eventually expanding it to add more user functionality with a backend.

The project is built with the following technologies:
  - Vue.js on the front end (with eventual typescript instead of js)
  - scss for stylesheets (i hate regular css)
  - yaml for the articles
