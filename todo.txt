series functionality

onInputChange sorts everything to see how many are sorted so 2x amount of work (possible server side fix)

Add meta data for each page

fix numbering in constitution

On full launch:
  -fix the submit page with the posts we love
  - 404.html should be the same as index.html

------------------
add a visual scroll bar to the left to show how much of the article is read
  - fix/maybe

caching images/loading smaller images
  - already done automatically i think


weird scroll issues when changing articles. (idk how to fix :( )

make the list of articles look much nicer. / Fix descriptions of articles
  - Now using the hook + I think it looks nice

Should we always be using ArticlesList?
  - No we use SimpleArticleGallery

consider separating the article content and meta data
  - probably wont bother with this for a while, not enough articles for it to make a meaningful difference.
