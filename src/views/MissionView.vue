      <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
      
      <p>
        Our mission is to create a platform for the sharing of previously underappreciated perspectives. We see our social and digital media landscape become increasingly polarised and exclusive. Not only with the echo chambers of mainstream social media, but also with increased paywalls. Further, most people cannot contribute to the civil discussion in widely read newspapers, and thus their voices are underheard. Our society functions on a platform of discussion, but we do not actually discuss, at least not with those who disagree with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are an online moderated forum that allows previously underappreciated perspectives to be shared in the form of opinion pieces. Anyone can share their essays with us, and have their work published for others to read. We commit to creating a place for the comfortable sharing of ideas, with guidelines that foster discussion and not division.
      </p>

      <p>
        We commit to being completely apolitical, which means that all sides of the political spectrum are not only welcome, but encouraged onto our platform. In fact, our platform only works if everyone not only reads, but also comments, publishes and moderates our platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also commit to being as unbiased as possible. Our platform is an entity without preconceived notions or beliefs. It is a place that allows others to share and discuss, without intruding unless absolutely necessary. We achieve this through careful moderation outlined in our constitution. Any moderation must be referred to the constitution, meaning users know the metrics of moderation. We welcome any criticism of our constitution, and are always open to changing it if we deem it necessary.
