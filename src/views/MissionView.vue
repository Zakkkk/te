      <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
      
      <p>
        As a group of interested, excited and passionate young people, we have a lot of views, opinions and insights that we'd love to share. We believe that this can only mean that other have this same desire, to express their feelings about the world. The problem comes in sharing this viewpoint with others, as there seems to be no space for us to express our viewpoint. Thus, we created the Thought Exchange, a place where we could express our thoughts, feelings and opinions on the world around us, as well as hear what others care deeply about.
      </p>

      <p>
        We care about the importance of discussion. The ability and right to have a viewpoint, share it, discuss it, and find people who can respectfully disagree. Unfortunately, in the internet age, or perhaps forever, it has become almost impossible to discuss important issues in a civilised manner that fosters useful solutions, so that is what The Thought Exchange is all about, a place that fosters ever important discussion about society, politics, economics and art. We are a welcoming platform that allows for constructive discussion about those issues that society cares, or should care about.
      </p>

      <p>
        Division is the scariest threat to our society, worse than climate change, nuclear warfare or artificial intelligence. It corrodes and splits our society into ever increasingly different groups, all of which exist in their own echo chambers, constantly reaffirming themselves that the enemy, those who are not in the group, are a reincarnation of the devil. In reality these people are other humans, with their own set of beliefs, biases and things that they care about. The devil is division, not other humans. And division impedes on our ability to progress, in whatever direction that might take. The Thought Exchange challenges this division. It is for this reason we do two things.

          As an organisation we are apolitical. This allows our platform to mediate discussion across the political spectrum. We commit to never affiliating ourselves with any political party, nor any politically aligned institution.
        </li>
        <li>
          We commit to challenging biases. Our contributors will be challenged to disclose any relevant biases, those being social, financial or political. A bias does not discredit an opinion, but it can provide insight into how an individual has reached their particular point of view.
