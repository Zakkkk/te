  # Republica (plant) {#Republica-plant}
  Republica is an enigmatic genus of flowering plants which includes three known species: Republica hickeyi, Republica kummerensis, and Republica litseafolia. The genus has been found in Eocene age geologic formations along the Pacific coast of North America. The affiliations of Republica are uncertain, with the most recent placement being tentatively in the now broken up subclass Hamamelididae. 

  ## Distribution
  The three species currently assigned to Republica are all known from western North America. The type species R. hickeyi is isolated to the Klondike Mountain Formation in the Ypresian Eocene Okanagan Highlands of northwest central Washington [Here is a link idfk](https://link-url-here.org)

  The first named species, R. litseafolia has been identified from its type locality at the "Chalk bluffs" site in the northern area of California's Ione Formation. The site has been variously assigned to the early Eocene by Harry MacGinitie, based on attempted correlation to the Ione type strata resulting in a Ypresian age often being reported.[2] However other authors suggest the age may be mistaken, based on anomalously low mean annual temperature estimates compared to other sites purported to be the same age located north and inland of the Chalk Bluffs site, with a possible 37 million years ago age begin suggested by Donald Prothero et al. (2011).[3] Leaves assigned to R. litseafolia were later reported by Jack Wolfe (1968) from the Eocene Puget Group floras of the Green River gorge in King County, Washington by Jack Wolfe.
